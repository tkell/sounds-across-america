      In the summer of 2021, Charles Van Kirk rode a bicycle 3,900 miles across the USA from the Atlantic Ocean in Round Pond, Maine to the Pacific in Florence, Oregon. He packed a field recorder in his handlebar bag and made recordings during the two month long journey through fourteen states.

Each pin on this map corresponds to a field recording made on the trip. In some cases, the recordings have been transformed into musical instruments. In others, they served as inspiration for a lyric or musical idea.
