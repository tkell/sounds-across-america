I was about halfway into a 93 mile ride from Yarmouth, ME to Stratham, NH. According to a thermometer on a bank in Biddeford, it was 100 degrees that day. I sang Third World's \"96 Degrees In The Shade\" to myself as I rode. I turned the crow into an arpeggiated synth with the Microcosm delay pedal and made a beat using mostly sounds recorded on the bike trip. ",

In addition to the natural reverb from the tunnel, I love what happened when I made copies of the vocal and tuned those copies as harmonies. The birds and raindrops in the background of the audio multiplied in their own weird ways. I used those harmonies as the basis for the track that is excerpted here.",
